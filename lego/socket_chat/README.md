The 'technologies' used:
  * Threading
  * Sockets
  * SQLite

  
How to test it:
  - 1.1. Start `Server.py` and `Client.py`
  - 1.2. Check the server's console. It should say something like `Starting server on 'localhost:8888'`
  - 1.3. In client, type in `!connect localhost 8888` 
  - 1.4. You will prompted to log in/register. Log in with root account `!login root M83Kj5QGxWCh2YMG` (that's the default root password)
  
  - 2.1. You are now logged in
  - 2.2. Type a few lines in chat
  - 2.3. Check the available commands with `!help`
  - 3.4. Test out some of the commands (e.g `!channels` and `!channel admin`). Please note that the root user has full access and some commands can be very destructive
  
  - 3.1. Open a new client without closing the first one
  - 3.2. Connect to the same server but this time create a new user with `!register testuser testpassword`
  - 3.3. Notice the chat history from the first account displayed
  - 3.4. Type a few lines and see how it's displayed on the other client
  - 3.5. Attempt to use different commands and see the permission difference between the accounts

  
Few additional notes:
  * There is no GUI as this was not the main focus of this project
  * Channels can have minimum permission requirements. If a user's rank is lower than specified for the channel, the user won't see the channel under the `!channels` command and won't be able to join
  * Channels can have slots assigned to them. For example, a channel with 5 slots can't have more than 5 members. An exception to this is the `join_full` permission, which grants the user the ability to bypass the slot limit.
  * Only the root account can be used to create and remove accounts/channels/permissions
